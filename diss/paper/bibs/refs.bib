The report describes the {AFCI} cost basis development process, reference information on {AFCI} cost modules, a procedure for estimating fuel cycle costs, economic evaluation guidelines, and a discussion on the integration of cost data into economic computer models. This report contains reference cost data for 26 cost modules—24 fuel cycle cost modules and 2 reactor modules. The cost modules were developed in the areas of natural uranium mining and milling, conversion, enrichment, depleted uranium disposition, fuel fabrication, interim spent fuel storage, reprocessing, waste conditioning, spent nuclear fuel ({SNF)} packaging, long-term monitored retrievable storage, near surface disposal of low-level waste ({LLW)}, geologic repository and other disposal concepts, and transportation processes for nuclear fuel, {LLW}, {SNF}, and high-level waste.},
