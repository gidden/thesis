This work would never have materialized without the dedicated students and staff
who comprise and have comprised the Fuel Cycle Group of the UW Computational
Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG). There would be no \Cyclus without
the dedication of Dr. Katy Huff, under whose watchful eye \Cyclus work was
initiated. I honed my programming chops through \Cyclus development with Robert
Carlsen, who has reviewed many a pull request of mine. \Cyclus would likely have
no users without the hard work of Dr. Anthony Scopatz, who also provided
valuable advice through many parts of the testing and analysis work herein
described. Dr. Paul Wilson has served as a thoughtful advisor and mentor
throughout my tenure at UW.

I would also like to thank the good folks at the Department of Energy's Nuclear
Energy University Program (NEUP) office. The majority of my time at UW was
funding by an NEUP fellowship, which provided the freedom necessary to chase
after a wacky idea like agent-based modeling of the nuclear fuel cycle. Getting
it right (enough) took a lot of work and effort that is only now starting to
bear fruit. The NEUP's support was crucial for this work.
