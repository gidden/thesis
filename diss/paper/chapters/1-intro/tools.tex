\subsection{Agent-Based Supply Chain Models}\label{intro:sim}

Supply and demand in nuclear fuel cycle simulation drives the flow of resources
between entities. The exchange of resources is the primary entity interaction
mechanism during a simulation. The supply and demand of a given fuel cycle
becomes highly complex when including the recycling of material. Even with such
a complication, the notion of a generic fuel cycle, i.e., from the perspective
of facilities that supply and demand material, quickly begins to look like a
supply chain model. There is a growing literature of agent-based supply chain
modeling
\cite{swaminathan_modeling_1998,julka_agent-based_2002,van_der_zee_modeling_2005,chatfield_multi-formalism_2007,holmgren_agent_2007}.
The general premise of these types of models is that individual facilities have
a notion of their needs (i.e., their demands) and can express to the system
these needs at the required time. There is heavy use of inventory policy to
determine the correct amount of material inventory that is needed and the
correct time to request a resupply. Such an approach has not heretofore been
attempted for the nuclear fuel cycle and would support a variety of use cases
outlined in \secref{intro:fcs}. For example, reactor facilities could be allowed
to be fueled by multiple fuel types (e.g., UOX or MOX), and decide which type to
choose based on the simulation environment.

\subsection{Cardinal Preferences and Game Theory}\label{intro:prefs}

The notion of social modeling in fuel cycle simulation, e.g., employing regional
bias, has to date been a secondary concern. Some semblance of this capability is
needed if one is to incorporate outside effects on a domestic fuel cycle
model. Furthermore, a robust capability is required if one wishes to actually
investigate dynamic interactions between regional entities. Again, a full
treatment of this sort of regional interaction would require international
relations models, most of which can be found in the cross-cutting disciplines of
economics, political science, and game theory. The primary solution technique in
game theory is Nash Equilibrium. It describes an optimal solution as follows:
given a set of players, states, preferences, and actions, all players choose an
action such that any single player's deviation from that actions results in a
state of lower preference for that player (thus no player has an incentive to
deviate) \cite{mccarty_political_2007}. There also exists a body of literature
that examine Nash Equilibria in the context of optimal flow models
\cite{mazumdar_fairness_1991,nagurney_supply_2002,song_nash_2002}. However, the
complexity of such models quickly brings them out of the scope of our needs,
i.e., dynamic modeling of multi-lateral scenarios ranging 100+ years in a
``reasonable'' amount of computation time. 

The game theoretic notion of preferences can be quite useful in fuel cycle
simualtion, however. Specifically, cardinal utility, or cardinal preferences
\cite{strotz_cardinal_1953} provides a relative measure of preference such that
any two preferences can be directly compared, provided an arbitrary scaling,
similar to the comparison of costs in a system. The notion of preference also
nicely extends the work of Oliver's affinity metric
\cite{oliver_geniusv2:_2009}. Costs in a nuclear fuel cycle simulation have
reasonably large uncertainty \cite{shropshire_advanced_2009} and are generally
applied to the output of a simulator as a post-processing step. Furthermore, for
many fuel cycle simulation cases, a cost proxy is directly applicable, because
actual cost values may be very hard to compute or determine \textit{within} a
simualation. For example, an analyst may know intuitively that reactors prefer
recycled fuel to fresh fuel in order to maximize resource
utilization. Especially for initial analyses, informing potential resource flows
via preferences, rather than costs, is simpler, quicker, and more
intuitive. Further, the notion of preference cleanly maps onto geopolitical
models, such as preferential trading, whereas cost usage can require significant
additional work to be meaningful. Enabling both preference and cost-based models
can provide sufficient simulation fidelity to appropriate analysts.

\subsection{Transportation Problems \& Mathematical Programming}\label{intro:prog}

The previous sections have outlined a specific need for nuclear fuel cycle
simulation: determining the flow of resources in a system of supply and demand,
given a variety of possible capacities and informed by economic and social
models. Constrained network flow determination is a canonical problem in
computer science and operations research. Further, there is a rich history and
capability of modeling such problems using mathematical programming.

A network flow model is represented by a graph, $G(N, A)$, comprised of nodes
$N$ and arcs $A$. If flow can occur between some node $i$ and some other node
$j$, then it flows along arc $(i, j)$. An example of a network-flow graph is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:node-arcs}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{./chapters/1-intro/figs/node-arcs.png}
  \caption{An example node-arc network configuration. Arrows denote possible
    flow directions. Arc notation examples are provided for arcs (1,4) and
    (4,6).}
  \label{fig:node-arcs}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Given a graph instance, an optimal flow between nodes can be found provided
\textit{objective coefficients} and \textit{constraints}. \textit{Decision
  variables} for this optimization problem comprise the optimal \textit{flow
  assignment}. If all decision variables are linear, then the resulting
formulation is termed a Linear Program (LP), and can be solved using related
techniques. A full discussion of LPs and their solution techniques is provided
in Appendix \ref{app:lp}. If any decision variables are integer, then the
resulting formulation is termed a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). For
instance, binary variables can be used in network-flow problems to denote
whether an arc has flow or not. A full discussion of MILPs and their solution
techniques is provided in Appendix \ref{app:ip}. Many different types of
problems can be solved using this structure. This work utilzes
\textit{transportation} problems, a specialization of the network-flow problems.

Transportation problems model the flow of a commodity between source nodes and
sink nodes. In other words, source nodes and sink nodes comprise two distinct
subsets, $N_1, N_2$, the union of which comprises all nodes in the
transportation graph, $N$. These properties can be described in set notation.

\begin{equation}
  N_1 \subset N
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 N_2 \subset N
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  N_1 \cup N_2 = N
\end{equation}

From the node-arc graph point of view, this strict subset division allows for
the transportation problem to be modeled as a \textit{bipartite} graph, an
example of which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:node-arcs-bipartite}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{./chapters/1-intro/figs/node-arcs-bipartite.png}
  \caption{An example node-arc transportation network configuration. Arrows
    denote possible flow directions. Note that all nodes either belong to the 
    set of sources (left) or set of sinks (right).}
  \label{fig:node-arcs-bipartite}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Many variations of the transportation problem exist. The minimum-cost
transportation problem is a useful example. In such a formulation, each arc has
an associated \textit{unit cost} associated with the cost of transporting a unit
of a commodity along it, $c_{i,j}$. Additionally, supplier and consumer nodes
have an associated supply, $s_i$, or demand, $d_i$, which provide a notion of
\textit{node capacity}. The minimum-cost transportation problem can be
formulated as a linear program as shown in Equation \ref{eqs:xport}.

%%% 
\begin{subequations}\label{eqs:xport}
  \begin{align}
    %%
    \min_{x} \:\: & 
    \sum_{(i, j) \in A} c_{i,j} x_{i,j}
    & \label{eqs:xport_obj} \\
    %%
    \text{s.t.} \:\: &
    \sum_{j \in N_2} x_{i,j} \leq s_i
    & \forall i \in N_1  \\
    %%
    &
    \sum_{i \in N_1} x_{i,j} \geq d_i
    & \forall j \in N_2  \\
    %%
    &
    x_{i,j} \geq 0
    & \forall (i, j) \in A \label{eqs:xport_x}
    %%
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
%%% 

An intuitive constraint on the problem to guarantee a feasible solution is that
the total demand in the system must be no greater than the total supply in the
system, shown in Equation \ref{eqs:xp_constr}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqs:xp_constr}
  \sum_{j \in N_2} d_j \leq \sum_{i \in N_1} s_i
\end{equation}

\noindent
A given problem instance may violate Equation \ref{eqs:xp_constr} and thus be
infeasible. Feasibility in this sense can be guaranteed by adding an artificial
supply node. Such a node can have infinite supply capacity but at (effectively)
infinite cost. The problem can then be solved, and any flow leaving the
artificial node in the optimal solution can be dealt with accordingly, e.g., it
can be ignored.

A more complex transportation-problem formulation can support systems in which
supply or demand can be met by multiple commodities.  Variables and constants in
the multi-commodity formulation are generally analogs of their counterparts in
the single-commodity problem. There is a unit cost $c_{i,j}^{h}$ for commodity
$h$ to traverse arc $(i,j)$. A supplier of commodity $h$ has a certain supply
capacity $s_i^h$ which cannot be surpassed and consumers of commodity $h$ have a
certain demand level which must be met, $d_i^h$.

In the simplest extension from the single-commodity to multi-commodity
transportation problem, arc constraints for all commodities are combined, i.e.,
there is a single capacity $u_{i,j}$ for a given arc $(i, j)$. A classic
application of this enhanced complexity deals with data networks. Multiple
classifications of data exist, but they all must traverse the same network
infrastructure. Accordingly, the infrastructure can only accommodate a certain
quantity of total flow among all communication types. The formulation of the
multi-commodity flow problem is shown in Equation \ref{eqs:MCTP}. Note the
commodity coupling in Equation \ref{eqs:MCTP_cap}.

%%% 
\begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MCTP}
  \begin{align}
    %%
    \min_{x} \:\: & 
    \sum_{i \in I}\sum_{j \in J}\sum_{h \in H} c_{i,j}^{h} x_{i,j}^{h}
    & \label{eqs:MCTP_obj} \\
    %%
    \text{s.t.} \:\: &
    \sum_{j \in J} x_{i,j}^{h} \leq s_{i}^{h}
    &
    \forall \: i \in I, \forall \: h \in H \label{eqs:MCTP_sup} \\
    %%
    &
    \sum_{i \in I} x_{i,j}^{h} \geq d_{j}^{h}
    & 
    \forall \: j \in J, \forall \: h \in H \label{eqs:MCTP_dem} \\
    %%
    &
    \sum_{h \in H} x_{i,j}^{h} \leq u_{i,j}
    & 
    \forall \: (i, j) \in A \label{eqs:MCTP_cap} \\
    %%
    &
    x_{i,j}^{k} \geq 0
    &
    \forall \: (i, j) \in A, \forall \: h \in H \label{eqs:MCTP_x}
    %%
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
%%% 

It can be possible to reduce instances of the multi-commodity transportation
problem. In the case in which is no arc that shares multiple commodities, the
multicommodity connection constraints disappear, and the single multi-commodity
problem can be broken into $m$ different single-commodity transportation
problems, where $m$ is the cardinality of the set of commodities, $H$. Such
reductions are important because optimization problems will generally scale
poorly with problem size.

Optimization problems are solved by solving a number of decision
problems. Decision problems are generally computationally
\textit{hard}. Decision problems ask yes or no questions, e.g., ``is there a
flow path with a flow larger than $x$?''. An optimization problem asks instead
``what is the flow path with the largest flow?''. Any problem can be associated
with one of four categories of computational complexity: Polynomial-time
($\mathcal{P}$), Non-deterministic Polynomial-time ($\mathcal{NP}$),
Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Complete ($\mathcal{NP}$-C), and
Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard ($\mathcal{NP}$-hard). 

A classic example of a polynomial-time algorithm is naive matrix inversion,
known to be of order $n^3$ (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$) for a given $n \times n$
matrix. A decision problem, on the other hand, is considered to be in
($\mathcal{NP}$) if for any proposed solution, there is a \textit{short
  certificate}.

\begin{define}
A \textbf{certificate} is a method to verify that a solutions provides a
positive or negative response to the question at hand. A certificate is
considered \textbf{short} if it is polynomial in size and can be verified in
polynomial time.
\end{define}

\noindent
A decision problem, $Q$, is considered to be in $\mathcal{NP}$-C, if $Q \in
\mathcal{NP}$ and \textit{any} problem, $P \in \mathcal{NP}$ is polynomial-time
reducible to $Q$. That is, instances of $P$ can be reformulated as instances of
$Q$ in polynomial time. The most popular candidate of this polynomial reduction
is the Satisfiability Problem, known to be in $\mathcal{NP}$-C
\cite{Cook:1971:CTP,levin1973universal}. Finally, a problem $Q$, is in
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard, if any problem $P \in \mathcal{NP}$ is polynomial-time
reducible to $Q$, but $Q \not\in \mathcal{NP}$. If a decision problem is in
$\mathcal{NP}$-C, then the corresponding optimization problem is
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard. The relationship between these set of problem complexities,
reflecting current understanding, is shown graphically in Figure
\ref{fig:complexity}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{./chapters/1-intro/figs/complexity.png}
  \caption{The relationship between the various types of computational complexities.}
  \label{fig:complexity}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Certain optimization problems can be solved with specialty algorithms that
greatly decrease solution times. However, because optimization problems are
$\mathcal{NP}\text{-hard}$, no guarantee can be made \textit{in general}
regarding their scalability. Worst case scenarios result in exponential scaling
with problem size. Further, in practice, MILPs experience much worse solution
time behavior than do LPs. In short, reducing problem size is an important
strategy for solving optimization problems more quickly.
