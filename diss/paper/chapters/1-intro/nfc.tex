\section{The Nuclear Fuel Cycle}

The nuclear fuel cycle can be described as a set of facilities that interact
with one another to either provide or consume fuel services. Facilities in the
fuel cycle act together to provide fuel to nuclear power plants which, in turn,
generate energy. The used fuel produced by the power plants is then returned to
servicing facilities to either be recycled or disposed. The overall goal of the
system is to produce power at a competitive price while managing externalities
of the process, the chief of which is spent nuclear fuel. Myriad strategies
exist to achieve this aim which can be classified along a spectrum of the degree
to which fuel is recycled. In general, fuel cycles that do not recycle fuel are
concerned most with cost, whereas fuel cycles that fully recycle fuel are
concerned most with issues of sustainability and inter-generational equity. It is
the goal of fuel cycle simulation to rigorously explore this option space.

\subsection{The Open Fuel Cycle}

The open, or once-through, fuel cycle is relatively simple and is in place in
most nation states that currently utilize nuclear power. In practice, the primary
fuel element used in this type of cycle is uranium; however, processed fertile
material, such as thorium, can also be used. The fuel cycle is considered open
because fuel that is used in a reactor is stored indefinitely once its
reactivity has dropped below useful levels.

Beginning the fuel cycle process, uranium ore is initially extracted from the
ground using one of a variety of techniques including open pit mining,
underground mining, and \textit{in situ} leaching. The uranium ore is then
milled to form yellowcake, $\mathrm{U_3O_8}$. The tailings, or byproducts, of
this process are slightly radioactive and are therefore considered to be
low-level waste (LLW) by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
(see \cite{nrc_10_1985}).

Certain reactors are designed to use naturally enriched uranium. For these
reactors, yellowcake can be directly reduced with oxygen to form naturally
enriched uranium oxide, $\mathrm{UO_2}$. For the majority of power reactors,
however, the uranium must be enriched with higher-than-natural levels of
uranium-235. In order to do so, yellowcake is sent to a conversion facility,
which converts it from $\mathrm{U_3O_8}$ to $\mathrm{UF_6}$. The uranium
hexafluoride is then enriched to the required level in an enrichment facility,
of which three classes exist: gaseous diffusion, the original enrichment
technology; centrifugal diffusion, the current enrichment technology; and Atomic
Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS), a newer technology not currently in
commercial production. The enriched uranium hexafluoride is then sent to a fuel
fabrication facility where it is returned to yellowcake form before being
reduced to uranium oxide. The uranium oxide is then sintered into pellets and
loaded into fuel assemblies to be placed in a reactor. This process, in
conjunction with uranium mining, is termed the \textit{front end} of the nuclear
fuel cycle.

Once fuel has been processed in a reactor, it is cooled off in pools for a
number of years, and then stored in dry casks before eventually being sent to a
final repository. The physical location of the fuel may vary during dry cask
storage between the reactor site or some other interim storage site.

Graphically, the open fuel cycle is shown in Figure \ref{fig:open-cycle}.

\subsection{The Closed Fuel Cycle}

The closed fuel cycle is one that includes the recycling of used, or spent, fuel
to be reused in a reactor. Recycling used nuclear fuel is expensive due to the
costs associated with handling highly radioactive material (e.g., capital costs
of hot cells, etc.). However, there are at least two overarching benefits that
contribute to lowering the overall cost of the fuel cycle: increasing repository
capacity and increasing fuel utilization.

Spent fuel that exits the average light water reactor (LWR) has an approximate
composition as shown in Table \ref{tab:lwr_fuel}. Of the elements that comprise
used fuel, uranium, plutonium, and the mixed actinides (MA) are all capable of
producing power through the fission process. The fission products, however,
contain isotopes with high neutron capture cross sections, which therefore act
as poisons to the nuclear chain reaction. Achieving theoretical 100\% fuel
utilization would thus require storing indefinitely only the fission products
and any other byproducts of the fuel cycle, rather than additionally having to
store other elemental groups produced by nuclear fission, e.g., minor
actinides. Furthermore, repository capacity is determined not only by total mass
or volume, but also by heat load and radiotoxicity, making the concentration of
high-activity isotopes one of the limiting factors in a repository's
capacity. Fission products are generally short-lived (in comparison to
transuranic elements, i.e., uranium, plutonium, and the MAs). Accordingly, for
repositories with long-term heat load limited capacities, minimizing the amount
of transuranics increases the amount of material that can be stored in a given
repository.

Fission Products  & $\sim$4   \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The act of reprocessing spent fuel is comprised of a number of
subprocesses. Once fuel has left the reactor core, it is stored in a spent fuel
pool for a some number of years, typically around five, in order to provide
enough time to lower decay heat to acceptable levels for handling of the
fuel. It can then be directly sent to a reprocessing facility or be sent for
some period of time to dry-cask storage. Reprocessing nuclear fuel is a chemical
extraction process and therefore is limited by chemical extraction
techniques. In general, there are two types of such processes: low-temperature
methods using organic solvents (e.g., PUREX), and high-temperature methods using
molten salts and metals, called pyroprocessing. The extraction techniques
separate the spent fuel into chemically-similar groups which can vary based on
the technique used, but generally align with those shown in Table
\ref{tab:lwr_fuel}. The separated streams are then sent either to a repository
as high-level waste (HLW) or to an appropriate fuel fabrication
facility. Graphically, the closed fuel cycle is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:closed-cycle}.

\begin{figure}[]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{closed_cycle.png}
  \caption{The closed fuel cycle as shown in \cite{cochran1990nuclear}.}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}


The elemental groups used in fuel fabrication will depend on the fuel cycle that
is developed. The currently-operating large-scale industrial reprocessing plants
(La Hague in France, THORP in the U.K., Mayak in Russia, and Rokkasho in Japan)
utilize the PUREX process to extract uranium and plutonium. The plutonium is
then oxidized and mixed with depleted uranium from the enrichment process to
produce mixed-oxide fuel (MOX). Other sources of uranium can be used to fill MOX
fuel, such as recycled uranium from reprocessing, as neutronics-related
reactivity and safety constraints allow. Other fuel cycles utilize the mixed
actinides elemental group as well. Generally, plutonium is included with the
mixed actinides, which results in a elemental category called the transuranic
(TRU) elements. These fuel cycles generally include fast reactors that convert
their TRU inventory into either more TRU (i.e., they have a conversion ratio
(CR) of greater than 1), less TRU (CR < 1), or they maintain the amount of TRU
entering and exiting their system (CR = 1). Fast reactors with CR > 1 are termed
breeder reactors.

It should be noted that with any reprocessing capability, nonproliferation
issues arise. Nuclear weapons have historically been produced using either
enriched uranium or reprocessed plutonium; however it is possible to produce one
with any mix of appropriate materials. Accordingly, any fuel cycle that exposes
bare plutonium streams has an inherently higher nonproliferation risk than one
that does not, and such risks must be weighed accordingly. However, the primary
nuclide that drive such plutonium-based weapons is \nucl{239}{Pu}. Additional
isotopes, e.g., \nucl{240}{Pu}, are considered ``impurities'' that dilute the
efficacy and reliability of plutonium-based weapons. In general, fuel exiting a
full LWR cycle have very poor plutonium profiles for the purpose of weapon
utilization.

\subsection{The Modified-Open Fuel Cycle}

The modified open fuel cycle is effectively a hybrid of the open and closed fuel
cycles. The Blue Ribbon Commission's Reactor and Fuel Cycle
Technology Subcommittee tackled a definition as follows:

\begin{quotation}
We have defined this category to encompass a very wide range of possible fuel
cycles with multiple possible combinations of different reactor, separations,
and fuel fabrication technologies. Our definition includes any fuel cycle in
which some of the spent fuel is processed rather than being directly disposed of
after a single pass through a reactor.~\cite{brc_reactor_2012}
