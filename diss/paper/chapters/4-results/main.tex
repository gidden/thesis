\chapter{Experiments \& Results}\label{ch:results}

\section{Experimental Setup}

Talk about specifics of computers used, how results are calculated, etc. Expand on specifics from prev chapter.

Specifically, the solution
time required to solve exchange instances is analyzed because this study is of
both a novel solution methodology to a novel problem, and because the problem is
by definition NP-Hard as described in \S \ref{intro:prog}.

\subsection{Solvers and Formulations}

The solvers used to determine solutions to the DRE instances are then described
in \S \ref{method:solve}. Three solvers are supported: COIN-CLP, COIN-CBC, and
the Greedy Hueristic described in \S \ref{abm:dre:nfctp:heur}.
