\chapter{Experiments \& Results}\label{ch:results}

Given a parameterized framework for generating instances of resource exchanges,
experiments are designed and executed to explore the efficiency and quality of
solutions provided by different solvers. \secref{results:setup} describes the
experimentation apparati, including the computational tools, solvers and
relevant output. Two experimental campaigns were conducted. A scaling campaign,
described in \secref{results:scale}, was performed in order to investigate
formulation behavior as a function of problem size. \secref {results:stochastic}
then describes the results of a stochastic campaign.
