\chapter{Experimentation Methodology}\label{ch:method}

The NFCTP is the first attempt at solving the supply and demand of the nuclear
fuel cycle in a dynamic manner within a NFC simulation. Accordingly, there is no
precedent for investigating the performance and efficacy of a given
approach. This chapter describes one such novel approach in which rules for
generating instances of exchanges are defined, exchanges are generated,
exchanges are executed, and results are analyzed. 

The chapter begins with a discussion of the generation of exchanges, in \S
\ref{method:setup}. Two types of exchanges are included: one in which reactors
are requesting fuel, and one in which reactors are supplying used fuel. In NFC
parlance, these are called the \textit{Front End} of the fuel cycle and
\textit{Back End} of the fuel cycle. Notably, both of these exchanges can occur
in the same time step. \S \ref{method:setup:split} describes how a full exchange
may be split into multiple exchanges for any given time step. 

Generating and solving instances of exchanges at a large scale is a difficult
problem. The Cyclopts (Cyclus Optimization Studies) framework was implemented
for this purpose. Cyclopts has both a Python and C layer. The Python layer is
largely responsible for generating exchanges and interfacing with an associated
persistence mechanism. The C layer is linked against the Cyclus kernel shared
object library and is responsible for calling directly into the kernel's
resource exchange API. \S \ref{method:tools} describes the implementation of
Cyclopts and its varied modes of operation.
