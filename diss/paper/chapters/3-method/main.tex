\chapter{Experimentation Methodology}\label{ch:method}

The NFCTP is the first attempt at solving the supply and demand of the nuclear
fuel cycle in a dynamic manner within a NFC simulation. Accordingly, there is no
precedent for investigating the performance and efficacy of a given
approach. This chapter describes an experimental methodology to assess the NFCTP
in which rules for generating instances of exchanges are defined, exchanges are
generated, exchanges are executed, and results are analyzed. The goal of this
work is twofold: demonstrate the generation of a large number of exchange
instances under reasonable assumptions, and analyze the effects and performance
of different solvers applied to those exchange instances.

The chapter begins with a discussion of the generation of exchanges, in \S
\ref{method:setup}. Two species of exchanges are included: one in which reactors
are requesting fuel, and one in which reactors are supplying used fuel. In NFC
parlance, these are called the \textit{front end} of the fuel cycle and
\textit{back end} of the fuel cycle. Notably, both of these exchanges occur
in the same time step. 

Generating and solving instances of exchanges at a large scale is a difficult
problem. The Cyclopts (\underline{Cycl}us \underline{Opt}imization
\underline{S}tudies) framework was implemented for this purpose, consisting of
both a Python and C++ layer. The Python layer is largely responsible for
generating exchanges and interfacing with an associated persistence
mechanism. The C++ layer is compiled and linked against the Cyclus kernel shared
object library, \texttt{libcyclus}, and is responsible for calling directly into
the kernel's resource exchange API. \secref{method:tools} describes the
implementation of Cyclopts and its varied modes of operation.
