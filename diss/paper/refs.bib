	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1132596},
	abstract = {The nuclear fuel cycle describes the process of the evolution of nuclear fuel from mining to eventual
interment. It is a complex system comprised of supplier and consumer facilities which act in a global
context. It is cyclical, i.e., fuel is not simply used and disposed of in all cases; the notion of the recycling
and reuse of fuel must be taken into account. Further complicating the analysis of the nuclear fuel cycle
are competing metrics, such as overall cost, repository capacity, support facility capacity, etc. Nuclear fuel
cycle simulators have been developed in order to ascertain the effect of different fuel cycle options, such
as fuel types, reactor types, and technology availability. Previous simulation technologies have relied
primarily on pure system dynamics approaches. This work describes an agent-based modeling approach
that allows increased modeling flexibility through the use of dynamically loadable agent actors. A linear
programming and mixed integer-linear programming variation of the multi-commodity transportation
problem is proposed to be used in the simulation framework to facilitate the matching of suppliers and
consumers of commodities. Modeling of recycling scenarios is achieved through a proposed approxima-
tion linear programming formulation with domain-specific constraints, allowing separated material to
be matched to multiple target fuel requests. The combination of the market resolution mechanism with
an automated recipe matching algorithm placed in the framework of the Cyclus simulation provides a
first-of-the-kind application of a dynamic, agent-based model of the nuclear fuel cycle.},

	abstract = {This report, commissioned by the {U.S.} Department of Energy ({DOE)}, provides a comprehensive set of cost data supporting a cost analysis for the relative economic comparison of options for use in the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative ({AFCI)} Program. The report describes the {AFCI} cost basis development process, reference information on {AFCI} cost modules, a procedure for estimating fuel cycle costs, economic evaluation guidelines, and a discussion on the integration of cost data into economic computer models. This report contains reference cost data for 26 cost modulesâ€”24 fuel cycle cost modules and 2 reactor modules. The cost modules were developed in the areas of natural uranium mining and milling, conversion, enrichment, depleted uranium disposition, fuel fabrication, interim spent fuel storage, reprocessing, waste conditioning, spent nuclear fuel ({SNF)} packaging, long-term monitored retrievable storage, near surface disposal of low-level waste ({LLW)}, geologic repository and other disposal concepts, and transportation processes for nuclear fuel, {LLW}, {SNF}, and high-level waste.},
