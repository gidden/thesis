  - types
  
  - technologies

-Fuel cycle simulation
----------------------

  - motivations

  - quasi static

    - quasi static overview

  - dynamic

    - dicussion of dynamic simulators

motivations 
------------

  - limitations of system dynamics

  - cyclus history

  - dynamic interation interface allows for rapid prototyping of archetypes

tools
------

  - modeling and simulation

    - classic simulation principles
  
    - agent based modeling

  - supply chain modeling
  
    - supply/demand problems

    - multicommodity transportation problem

  - mathematicals programming

    - lp and solvers

    - milp and solvers

Agent Based Modeling in Cyclus
==============================

simulation overview
--------------------

  - time phases, parent child, etc.

regions, institutions, and facilities
--------------------------------------

  - agents modeled

  - proof of principle simulations

dynamic resource exchange
--------------------

  - summary of all info so far

Experimental Setup
==================

motivation
--------------------

  - splitting exchanges

reactors requesting fuel
--------------------

reactors supplying fuel
--------------------

cyclopts
--------------------

  - overview/goal

  - phases (conversion, execution, pp)

  - hdf5

    - layout choice
 
    - compression choice

  - interfacing with condor

Experiments and Results
=======================

  - basically ^

Conclusions
===========

  - how did we perform in general

  - what domain are solvers acceptable

  - how are supply/request cases different

  - where are solvers suggested

  - what can be improved

  - where can you go next
