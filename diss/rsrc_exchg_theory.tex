The exchange of resources in Cyclus is designed to create a generic resource
exchange graph that can be solved to determine the matched supply and demand of
resources amongst agents in a simulation.

In general, a resource exchange is made up of \textit{requests} and
\textit{bids}. A request defines a specific resource that is demanded by an
agent in the simulation. A bid defines a corresponding resource that is offered
to meet a given request.

Requests and bids can be mutually constraining, i.e., they can be grouped into
mutually-constraining sets. For example, a supplier agent may respond to many
requests but may only be able to meet a certain fraction of them; accordingly
the bids from this supplier agent can be grouped into a single constraining set.
