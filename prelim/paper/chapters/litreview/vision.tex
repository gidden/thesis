The Verifiable Fuel Cycle Simulation (VISION) code is developed at the Idaho
National Lab (INL) and is a Powersim \cite{studio_powersim_2003} application
with input and output functionality provided through Excel spreadsheets. The
original VISION code base was taken from the DYMOND
\cite{moisseytsev_dymond_2001} after internal memory limits were reached in its
application language, Stella \cite{clauset_stella_1987}. VISION explicitly
models reactors, separations, fuel fabrication, storage and repository
facilities. ``Front end'' facilities, i.e. mining, conversion, and enrichment
facilities, are not explicitly modeled \cite{guerin_benchmark_2009}. The stated
goal of VISION is two-fold, to investigate infrastructure requirements for
various fuel cycles (termed ``what if'' scenarios)
\cite{jacobson_verifiable_2010} and to investigate upset scenarios, e.g. a loss
of a fuel fabrication facility, and corresponding mitigation strategies
\cite{schweitzer_improved_2008}.
