Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} introduced three major simulation-level design decisions
with some specific subcategories for each. Although it is not possible to
analyze these decisions for all reviewed simulators due to a lack of available
literature, it is possible to do so for three: CAFCA, COSI, and VISION.

While most of the above information is not available for DANESS, it does
introduce additional functionality by allowing minimum-cost deployments,
constraining deployment based on a percentage of future required material (thus
allowing facilities to idle if not fueled), and treating facilities
individually, rather than explicitly as a fleet. It is not clear from the
literature if the facilities are only tracked individually or if they are
specifically interacted with on an individual basis.
