A number of current fuel cycle simulators are reviewed in this section with a
keen focus of simulation-developer related design aspects. There are broadly two
main categories that simulation developers must address: how simulation entities
enter a given simulation and how simulation entities interact, or are connected,
in a simulation. The former varies by each simulator, whereas the latter is
handled by proprietary system dynamics software in most cases. Peripheral
concerns are also addressed, namely simulation input/output and the associated
coding platform(s). Because all current fuel cycle simulators are effectively
closed source, any knowledge of their inner workings must be gleaned from the
available literature published by their respective development
teams. Additionally, summary information can be gathered from the MIT
benchmarking exercise \cite{guerin_benchmark_2009}, because the sections
corresponding to each simulator were written by the simulator developers. From a
developers perspective, assumptions are made when the literature does not
provide a clear explanation of a given design decision, but such assumptions are
expressly noted.
