Commelini-Sicart (COSI) is a fuel cycle simulation code developed by the French
Commissariat \`{a} l'\'{e}nergie atomique (CEA), written in the Java programming
language. Accordingly, it can be classified as an object oriented simulator. The
stated goal of COSI is to model the amount and isotopics of material at each
stage in the fuel cycle, explicitly modeling reactor parks and their supporting
facilities (i.e., enrichment, separations, and fuel fabrication) in order to
study transition scenarios at a high level of isotopic and physical fidelity \cite{}.
