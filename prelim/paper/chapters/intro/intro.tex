\section{The Nuclear Fuel Cycle}

The nuclear fuel cycle can be described as a set of facilities that interact
with one another to either provide or consume fuel services. Facilities in the
fuel cycle act together to provide fuel to nuclear power plants which, in turn,
generate energy. The used fuel produced by the power plants is then returned to
servicing facilities to either recycle or dispose. The overall goal of the
system is to produce power at a competitive price while managing externalities
of the process, the chief of which is spent nuclear fuel. Myriad strategies
exist to achieve this aim which can be classified along a spectrum of the degree
to which fuel is recycled. In general, fuel cycles on the end of the spectrum
that does not recycle fuel are concerned most with cost, whereas fuel cycles
that fully recycle fuel are concerned most with issues of sustainability and
intergenerational equity. It is the goal of fuel cycle simulation to rigorously
explore this option space.
