\section{The Nuclear Fuel Cycle}

The nuclear fuel cycle, in general, can be described as a set of facilities that
interact with one another to either provide or consume fuel services. The
overall goal of the nuclear fuel cycle is to provide fuel to nuclear power
plants which, in turn, generate energy. The overall goal of the system is to
produce power at a competitive price while managing externalities of the
process, the chief of which is spent nuclear fuel. There exist a myriad of
strategies to achieve this aim which generally fall along a spectrum of the
degree to which fuel is recycled. In general, fuel cycles on the end of the
spectrum that does not recycle fuel are concerned most with cost, whereas fuel
cycles that fully recycle fuel are concerned most with issues of sustainability
and intergenerational equity.

\subsection{Benchmarks}

In his conclusions of the MIT benchmarking exercise, Guerin states that
``operation of a fuel cycle model is as much art as science''
\cite{guerin_benchmark_2009}. Understanding just how much of FCS is art and how
much is science is critical to providing reliable results.
