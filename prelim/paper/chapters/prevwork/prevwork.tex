\chapter{Previous Work}\label{ch:prevwork}

The previous work I've completed has focused primarily on efforts to run and
benchmark simple, once-through fuel cycle simulations with \Cyclus. Supporting
this effort has required not only additions to the \Cyclus code base to model
enrichment and reactor facilities, but also to the peripherial (i.e., linking
and input/output) and simulation-related infrastructure.

Signifigant, strategic improvements have been added to the \Cyclus code base
regarding interactions with dynamically-loadable libraries and reading xml-input
files. Basic simulation setup and execution has been revised to provide clear
phases of intialization. Tools have also been added to provide agent-based
management of building and instatiation of child agents, i.e., facilities in the
\Cyclus simulation. A (currently) separate library, named \Cyclopts, has been
developed to provide an interface to optimization solvers which supports
COIN-OR's linear and integer program solvers. Management of the actual building
(instantiation) of facilities within the simulation framework has been
encapsulated in a supplier/manager class pair.

Additonal support has been added specifically regarding to model
enrichment-related calculations, allowing for enrichment facilities to be
developed in \Cycamore.
