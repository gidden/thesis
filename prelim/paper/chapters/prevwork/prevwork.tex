\chapter{Previous Work}\label{ch:prevwork}

The previous work I've completed has focused primarily on efforts to run and
benchmark simple, once-through fuel cycle simulations with \Cyclus. Supporting
this effort has required not only additions to the \Cyclus code base to model
enrichment and reactor facilities, but also to the peripherial (i.e., linking
and input/output) and simulation-related infrastructure.

Signifigant, strategic improvements have been added to the \Cyclus code base
regarding interactions with dynamically-loadable libraries and reading xml-input
files. Basic simulation setup and execution has been revised to provide clear
phases of intialization. Tools have also been added to provide agent-based
management of building and instatiation of child agents, i.e., facilities in the
\Cyclus simulation. A (currently) separate library, named \Cyclopts, has been
developed to provide an interface to optimization solvers which currently
supports COIN-OR's linear and integer program solvers. Management of the actual
building (instantiation) of facilities within the simulation framework has been
encapsulated in a supplier/manager class pair. Finally, additional support has
been added specifically regarding to model enrichment-related calculations,
allowing for enrichment facilities to be developed in \Cycamore.

The combination of the above enhancements, in addition to developing an
enrichment and batch-based reactor facility models, as well as a managerial
institution model and demand-based region model, resulted in a \Cyclus
once-through fuel cycle simulation. In order to benchmark the basic simulation
infrastructure, the INPRO \cite{_international_2009} once-through benchmark was
used and compared with results from the VISION \cite{yacout_vision_2006}
code. Output closely matched for both reactor growth, gross material flows, and
SWUs utilized. Discrepencies were seen for the amount of natural uranium
utilized. The exercise of developing an input file for the the benchmark
specification was tedious due to the lack of published specifications. After a
review of other benchmarks, this was shown to be a common problem in addition to
a general lack fully specifying benchmark scenarios. Accordingly, a new
specification language was proposed and implemented, and a translation package
was implemented in order to translate that input into a \Cyclus input file.
