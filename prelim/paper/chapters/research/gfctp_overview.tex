This section describes a mathematical programming formulation that can be used
in \Cyclus simulations to determine material flows between simulation
entities. The formulation is informed by the supply-demand parameters gathered
by the methodology described in the previous section. The basis for the
formulation is the Multi-commodity Transportation Problem described
in \S\ref{sec:MCTP} with some departures described in detail below. Two separate
formulations are provided. The first is a strictly linear program. It is
proposed a basis for proof-of-principle work which may not fully adequately
describe supply-demand scenarios. A primary example of its shortcoming is that
it allows split orders, i.e., orders that are not fully filled. The nuclear fuel
cycle deals with bundled orders, such as nuclear fuel assemblies, thus this
modeling paradigm is only an approximation. Accordingly, a mixed integer-linear
formulation is also provided to address this concern. It splits the class of
orders into two distinct sets, one that allows order splitting and one that does
not. Solving the more complex problem will result in longer simulation times.
Accordingly, one of the focuses of this research is to determine the effect on
the simulation between the two formulations and analyze the cases in which
additional fidelity is needed.
