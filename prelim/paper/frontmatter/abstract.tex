The nuclear fuel cycle is the evolution of nuclear fuel from mining to eventual
interment. It is a complex system comprised of supplier and consumer facilities
which act in a global context. Furthermore, it is a cycle, i.e., fuel is not
simply used and disposed of in all cases; the notion of the recycling and reuse
of fuel must be taken into account. Further complicating the analysis of the
nuclear fuel cycle are competing metrics, such as overall cost, repository
capacity, support facility capacity, etc. Nuclear fuel cycle simulators have
been developed in order to ascertain the effect of different fuel cycle options,
such as fuel types, reactor types, and technology availability. Previous
simulation technologies have relied primarily on pure system dynamics
approaches. This work describes an agent-based modeling approach that allows
increased modeling flexibility through the use of dynamically loadable agent
actors. A linear programming and mixed integer-linear programming variation of
the multi-commodity transportation problem is proposed to be used in the
simulation framework to facilitate the matching of suppliers and consumers of
commodities. Modeling of recycling scenarios is achieved through a proposed
approximation linear programming formulation with domain-specific constraints,
allowing separated material to be matched to multiple target fuel requests. The
combination of the market resolution mechanism with an automated recipe matching
algorithm placed in the framework of the \Cyclus simulation provides a
first-of-the-kind application of agent-based modeling of the nuclear fuel cycle.
