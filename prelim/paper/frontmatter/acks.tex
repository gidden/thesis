%   It is customary for authors of academic books to include in their prefaces
%   statements such as this: ``I am indebted to ... for their invaluable help;
%   however, any errors which remain are my sole responsibility.'' Occasionally
%   an author will go further. Rather than say that if there are any mistakes
%   then he is responsible for them, he will say that there will inevitably be
%   some mistakes and he is responsible for them....

%   Although the shouldering of all responsibility is usually a social ritual,
%   the admission that errors exist is not --- it is often a sincere avowal of
%   belief. But this appears to present a living and everyday example of a
%   situation which philosophers have commonly dismissed as absurd; that it is
%   sometimes rational to hold logically incompatible beliefs.

I would like thank my advisor, Professor Paul Wilson, for his guidance through
this long process. Additionally, the \Cyclus code base is a collaborative work
that wouldn't be possible without the tireless work of Kathryn Huff and Robert
Carlsen. It's a team effort; thank you very, very much. I'd also like to thank
the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy University Program for their funding
of the first years of my work through their fellowship program.

From a personal standpoint, I would also like to thank my parents, Melanie and
Howard Gidden. Their vision for what kind of man I could be has shaped the man I
am today. I am also indebted to Dr. Jean Ragusa, who first introduced me to the
world of programming and numerical methods. I would also not be the programmer
and graduate student I am today without the assistance of Animal1, Southside,
and Scopz. Finally, I would like to thank my best of friends, Maggie Maes, for
staying by my side during times dark and light.
