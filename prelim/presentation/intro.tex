%%   Each simulation effort has a number of choices when modeling the nuclear fuel
%%   cycle, including:
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item what simulation engine kernel to use
%%     \item what platform to build their simulation upon
%%     \item the level of complexity with which to model simulation entity
%%       interaction
%%     \item the level of fidelity with which to model physical processes
%%     \item the time-scale granularity
